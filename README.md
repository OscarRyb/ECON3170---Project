# ECON3170---Project
For the compulsory tuition activity in ECON3170 H23, my objective is to generate predictions for Norways GDP using a large number of macroeconomic time-series data.

(using VAR and DFMs)

## Data sources
Primarily, I will be getting my data from Statistisk Sentralbyr√• (SSB) and Norges Bank
Both SSB and Norges Bank has a tremendous amount of historical data that can be useful in predicting, however it is not compiled into a single and easy-to-use database. To be able to forecast the variable of interest, it will require compiling all this data into one
single dataframe containing the predictor series and the series I wish to forecast.

## Empirical Approach
